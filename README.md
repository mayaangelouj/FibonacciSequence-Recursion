# FibonacciSequence-Recursion

<h2> The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.</h2>



<h1>Control Flow: </h1>
  <p>Loops use iterative control flow, while recursion uses function calls.<br>
Memory: Loops are generally more memory-efficient, while recursion can lead to higher memory usage due to the call stack.</p>
<h1>Readability: </h1>
  <p>Recursion can make code more readable and elegant for problems that have a natural recursive structure, like tree traversals.</p>
  
<h1>Performance: </h1>
  <p>Loops can be more efficient in terms of time and space, especially for problems that donâ€™t naturally fit a recursive approach.</p>

<h3> In the loop-based Fibonacci function, we use a single for loop that iterates n-1 times to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.<br></h3>
  
<h3>In the recursive Fibonacci function, the function calls itself twice for each non-base case (i.e., fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) and fibonacciRecursive(n - 2)).</h3>
