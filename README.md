# FibonacciSequence-Recursion

<h3> The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.</h3>


<h3>
Control Flow: Loops use iterative control flow, while recursion uses function calls.<br>
Memory: Loops are generally more memory-efficient, while recursion can lead to higher memory usage due to the call stack.<br>
Readability: Recursion can make code more readable and elegant for problems that have a natural recursive structure, like tree traversals.<br>
Performance: Loops can be more efficient in terms of time and space, especially for problems that donâ€™t naturally fit a recursive approach. </h3>

<h3> In the loop-based Fibonacci function, we use a single for loop that iterates n-1 times to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.<br>
In the recursive Fibonacci function, the function calls itself twice for each non-base case (i.e., fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) and fibonacciRecursive(n - 2)).
